# Wine Quality Analysis and Prediction

This project explores the physicochemical properties of red and white wines and their relationship to quality ratings. Using the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I analyze key features through data visualizations and apply a multiple linear regression model to predict wine quality. I find that alcohol is the strongest correlate of wine quality. 

# Objectives
* Understand how alcohol, acidity, sugar, and sulphates influence wine quality.
* Visualize correlations and distribution patterns using Python libraries like seaborn and matplotlib.
* Build and evaluate a regression model to predict wine quality scores.
* Expand from linear regression to Random Forest (RF) to further assess the potential of using RF for prediction power.

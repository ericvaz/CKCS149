# Wine Quality Analysis and Prediction

This project explores the physicochemical properties of red and white wines and their relationship to quality ratings. Using the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we analyze key features through data visualizations and apply a multiple linear regression model to predict wine quality.

# Objectives
* Understand how alcohol, acidity, sugar, and sulphates influence wine quality.
* Visualize correlations and distribution patterns using Python libraries like seaborn and matplotlib.
* Build and evaluate a regression model to predict wine quality scores.

# Dataset

* Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Wine Quality Data Set
* Format: CSV
* Variables: Eleven physicochemical inputs, one quality score output (0–10)

# Proposed Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
* Jupyter Notebook

# Deliverables

* Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
* Regression model with training/testing evaluation
* Final conclusions and insights

# Output
This project is presented as a Jupyter Notebook, exported as an HTML file for web-based viewing.
